# Image-processing
Processing a BMP image with C. 

Steps of the project:

1 - Encrypt the image

2 - Decrypting the image

3 - Processing the image and try to guess the handwriting numbers using Template matching

---

For the encryption part I used a cypher key.  
With this key I generated pseudo-random numbers with XORSHIFT32 algorithm, and with that number I was able to generate a permutation for the bitmap pixels.  
After the bitmap was permuted I changed the pixels using xor between the pixels (RGB values) and the pseudo-random numbers generated.   
The decryption was possible thanks to the xor properties.  
Example of encryption:

<p align="left">
  <img src="peppers.bmp" width="250" ">
  <img src="peppersenc.bmp" width="250" ">
</p>  

We can see that the Chi-squared test values of the encrypted image are bellow 293.25 so the distribution of the pixels is uniform.

In the second part of the project I implemented a template-matching algorithm that is guessing handwriting numbers.  
The algorithm determines the Cross-correlation between a template of a number and cut portions from bitmap.
The correlation is valid if it is greater than a certain threshold that is given by the user.    

For 0.5 correlation threshold:
